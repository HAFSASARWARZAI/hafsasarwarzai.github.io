    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>It's likely that there is a bucket inside the mystery black box connected to two tubes, ones to let the water in the bucket and the other to let the water 
    out of the box based on the data we collected</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a large box in which we pour in the water on the input, which is the funnel then sometimes the water comes out in the output, without 
   telling us exactly how the water comes or stays in the box for storage. Our initial data/observation was about what's inside the mystery black box, when we tested
    the mystery box with 500mL of water, 0mL of water came out and when we tested the mystery box again with another 500mL of water, 110mL of water came out and as we
    were experimenting with the mystery box, we tilted the box forward which made the box leak. </p>
