    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>It's likely that there is a bucket inside the mystery black box connected to two tubes, ones to let the water in the bucket and the other to let the water 
    out of the box based on the data we collected</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>The mystery black box is a large box in which we pour in the water on the input, which is the funnel then sometimes the water comes out in the output, without 
   telling us exactly how the water comes or stays in the box for storage. Our initial data/observation was about what was inside the mystery black box, when we tested
    the mystery box with 500mL of water, 0mL of water came out and when we tested the mystery box again with another 500mL of water, 110mL of water came out and as we
    were experimenting with the mystery box, we tilted the box forward which made the box leak. When we tested our own model with 211mL of water, 150mL came out and
    as a bonus, it was leaking just like the mystery box. The same explanation to the mystery black box, when we tested the mystery black box with 500mL of water, 0mL of 
    water came out, so this gives us a specific idea that sometimes more water comes out and sometimes less water comes out. In our approach to figuring out how the real
    mystery box worked, we did a few trials with our model to compare our model and the mystery black box. Our model's key structure was a bucket for storage and to that 
    bucket, there were two tubes connected to it, one to let the water in the bucket and the other to let the water out of the bucket/box. To test our model we put a 
    significant amount of water into our model for each trial and on each trial, less of that water came out and it was leaking just like the mystery black box. In
    conclusion, I think our model and the mystery black box have the same key structure based on the experiments we did and the data we collected.</p>
